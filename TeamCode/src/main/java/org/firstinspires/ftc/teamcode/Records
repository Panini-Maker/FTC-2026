Software Records:

11/25/2025:
- Old DriveActions code is inconsistent.
- Decided to switch to Roadrunner for better accuracy.
- Began tuning roadrunner for autonomous.
- Forward push test inconsistent due to a wrong motor naming.

11/26/2025:
- Finished tuning roadrunner.
- Long Autonomous code testing and completion.
- Roadrunner is very consistent.
- Created 6 artifact and 9 artifact long autonomous code to adapt to different scenarios.
- Quan wanted the autonomous to be empty the classifier ramp.
- Started working on Short Autonomous code.

11/27/2025:
- Short Autonomous code testing.
- strafeToLinearHeading() function is inaccurate.
- Tried other functions, but still inaccurate.
- Decided to use strafeTo() function instead.
- Roadrunner unable to move to position (24, 24)
- Back right wheel is unable to move.
- Roadrunner tried to move to coordinates (24, 24) but failed.
- Issue: Pulley came loose on back right wheel.
- Chat with Minh about fixing the pulley issue.
- Discussed with Minh about resetting the classifier ramp after autonomous.
- Realized that points for pattern are only awarded at the end of autonomous.
- Decided to focus on fixing the back right wheel issue first.
- Planned to have a team meeting on Sunday to discuss classifier resetting in autonomous.

11/28/2025:
- Created "Records" document to log software changes and issues.
- Documenting all changes and issues for future reference.
- Fixed back right wheel issue.
- Resumed testing Short Autonomous code for driver practice on Sunday (11/30/2025).
- Full field assembly at Sasha's house for blue autonomous and driver practice.
- Need to make short autonomous code for 6 artifacts and attempt 12 if we have time.
- Refactored autonomous code to a separate class for better organization.
- Improved readability and maintainability of autonomous code.
- New functions to make autonomous code cleaner and easier to understand.
- New variables for commonly used positions in autonomous.
- Hardware fixing robot issues.
- Wooden plates are cracked and need replacement.
- Replaced small cracked wooden plates with 3d printed parts.
- M3 screw hole could not stand the pressure of an M4 screw.
- Solution: drill a larger hole for M4 screws and replace cracked plate later.
- Wood plates to be replaced by aluminum plates in the future for durability.
- Complaint from Minh: "Huy did not name the wires and wire organization is bad."
- Plan to organize wires and label them properly.
- Robot drive train taken apart for maintenance and fixing issues.
- Complaint from Minh: "The robot is very slow, it runs on 200-220 rpm. It should run on 400 rpm."
- Long autonomous code is working well from blue alliance working.
- New issue: Due to the shooter angle, the robot spends more time turning to collect artifacts.
- Decided to disable the 6 artifact auto now because drivers can turn the 9 artifact auto off early.
- Design team to make a turret for shooter to reduce turning time.
- Removed classifier ramp resetting code from autonomous for now.
- Software team (Minh, Sasha) overrides driver decision to reset classifier ramp after autonomous.
- Reflection code fails, roadrunner unable to move to target position.
- Solution: move to its own class and tune them separately.
- Roadrunner still inaccurate, may need to retune it

11/30/2025:
- Driver practice at Sasha's house with full field assembly.
- Fixed teleop aimbot code for better accuracy.
- Autonomous code tested and working well.
- NOTE: Since there is time left after autonomous program ends, code can collect 3 more artifacts.
- EDIT: The above note can be implemented during December break.
- Aimbot still inaccurate, needs further tuning.
- Decided to try using turn to heading function for better accuracy and camera to align with the target.
- Also considered using roadrunner to move to shooting positions in teleop.
- Sometimes, autonomous code fails to move properly.
- Potential issue: code is started to fast and odometry doesn't have enough time to initialize.
- After some testing, found that auto aim works fine, the robot just can't move so the camera can take a photo.
- Noticed that for a specific shooting position, shotgun shoots too short and sniper shoots too far.
- Auto aim could be improved by increasing speed depending on angle difference.
- Also, auto aim should be toggled by a button, not a trigger.

12/07/2025:
- Team discussion on further robot development.
- Option 1: Keep the current robot design and cut aluminium plates for structural components soon.
    The new shooter design that hardware team have been working on will not fit the current robot,
    so it can not be used for the current design and it is very likely that the shooter will not
    be changed. We will have the robot design as is. The scores range is about 80-98 last time you
    guys test at Sasha’s house without any other robots on the field, split about the same between
    autonomous and teleop. Expect it is much harder to score in games with 4 robots present, but
    teleop should be able to score more when drivers have more time to practice.

- Option 2: Go with the new design (expect to have better shooter with ability to rotate
    horizontally and change angle vertically, better intake to grab artifacts easier and faster),
    hardware team will need more time to finish design and, build and test the new the design with
    wood plates, finalize and order aluminium cutting at the latest by Dec 20th. It will be very tight
    if we get in Jan competition and want to compete with aluminium build, but should be fine for Feb comp.

- Sasha to get individual opinions

12/08/2025:
- Statement: "We should go with option 2"
- Question: "State your view on the above statement (strongly agree, agree, slightly agree,
    neither agree nor disagree, slightly disagree, disagree, strongly disagree). Please explain your
    choice and be honest as this will go to records"

Supporting Views:
- Minh: "Strongly Agree. Because I'm always looking to new and better improvements I think we should
    go above and beyond, because it's a learning opportunity and taking risks is key to success"

- Huy: "Strongly Agree. A renewed design would be better for our team because a better robot would
    give us a higher chance of making it to regionals, compared to our current design."

- Daniel: "I strongly agree with the new design because of the intake."

- Kori: "I agree because the new robot will allow for better future performance and will be better
    in the long term. It also outweighs the short term cons and we will probably eventually change
    our robot anyways"

- Elsa: "Slightly agree, it seems like the better choice as the robot has a lot more advantages
    such as more advanced shooter and easier to manage. Only concerns are tight schedule and
    drivers (if there’s enough time for them to practice before the tournament)"

- Quan: "Slightly agree. Current shooter sucks but option 2 takes a lot of time slightly as in
    (neither agree nor disagree) + 0.1."

Neutral or Undecided:
- Sasha: "Neither Agree Nor Disagree. If we go with the old design, then the drive team can get a
    month and a half to train. However, the old design is very awkward to shoot. Switching to the
    new design would eliminate that, but it would also mean that if this goes to plan, the drive
    and software teams get only one week to code and train with the aluminium robot."

Opposing Views: None

12/09/2025:
- Fixing auto aim code to improve accuracy.
- Plan for new robot design development:
    - When wood prototype is done, start testing and tuning aim-assist code with new shooter.
    - Do not retune roadrunner until aluminium parts arrive.
    - Once aluminium parts arrive, start assembly immediately.
    - After assembly, start driver practice as soon as possible.
    - Tuning roadrunner for new robot design.

12/22/2025:
- TODO: Rename all occurrences of "leftShooter" to "shooterMotor" because there is only one shooter motor now.
    - EDIT: Never mind, there are two shooter motors, left and right.
