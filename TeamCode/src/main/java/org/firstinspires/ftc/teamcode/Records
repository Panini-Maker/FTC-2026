Software Records:

11/25/2025:
- Old DriveActions code is inconsistent.
- Decided to switch to Roadrunner for better accuracy.
- Began tuning roadrunner for autonomous.
- Forward push test inconsistent due to a wrong motor naming.

11/26/2025:
- Finished tuning roadrunner.
- Long Autonomous code testing and completion.
- Roadrunner is very consistent.
- Created 6 artifact and 9 artifact long autonomous code to adapt to different scenarios.
- Quan wanted the autonomous to be empty the classifier ramp.
- Started working on Short Autonomous code.

11/27/2025:
- Short Autonomous code testing.
- strafeToLinearHeading() function is inaccurate.
- Tried other functions, but still inaccurate.
- Decided to use strafeTo() function instead.
- Roadrunner unable to move to position (24, 24)
- Back right wheel is unable to move.
- Roadrunner tried to move to coordinates (24, 24) but failed.
- Issue: Pulley came loose on back right wheel.
- Chat with Minh about fixing the pulley issue.
- Discussed with Minh about resetting the classifier ramp after autonomous.
- Realized that points for pattern are only awarded at the end of autonomous.
- Decided to focus on fixing the back right wheel issue first.
- Planned to have a team meeting on Sunday to discuss classifier resetting in autonomous.

11/28/2025:
- Created "Records" document to log software changes and issues.
- Documenting all changes and issues for future reference.
- Fixed back right wheel issue.
- Resumed testing Short Autonomous code for driver practice on Sunday (11/30/2025).
- Full field assembly at Sasha's house for blue autonomous and driver practice.
- Need to make short autonomous code for 6 artifacts and attempt 12 if we have time.
- Refactored autonomous code to a separate class for better organization.
- Improved readability and maintainability of autonomous code.
- New functions to make autonomous code cleaner and easier to understand.
- New variables for commonly used positions in autonomous.
- Hardware fixing robot issues.
- Wooden plates are cracked and need replacement.
- Replaced small cracked wooden plates with 3d printed parts.
- M3 screw hole could not stand the pressure of an M4 screw.
- Solution: drill a larger hole for M4 screws and replace cracked plate later.
- Wood plates to be replaced by aluminum plates in the future for durability.
- Complaint from Minh: "Huy did not name the wires and wire organization is bad."
- Plan to organize wires and label them properly.
- Robot drive train taken apart for maintenance and fixing issues.
- Complaint from Minh: "The robot is very slow, it runs on 200-220 rpm. It should run on 400 rpm."
- Long autonomous code is working well from blue alliance working.
- New issue: Due to the shooter angle, the robot spends more time turning to collect artifacts.
- Decided to disable the 6 artifact auto now because drivers can turn the 9 artifact auto off early.
- Design team to make a turret for shooter to reduce turning time.
- Removed classifier ramp resetting code from autonomous for now.
- Software team (Minh, Sasha) overrides driver decision to reset classifier ramp after autonomous.
- Reflection code fails, roadrunner unable to move to target position.
- Solution: move to its own class and tune them separately.
- Roadrunner still inaccurate, may need to retune it

11/30/2025:
- Driver practice at Sasha's house with full field assembly.
- Fixed teleop aimbot code for better accuracy.
- Autonomous code tested and working well.
- NOTE: Since there is time left after autonomous program ends, code can collect 3 more artifacts.
- EDIT: The above note can be implemented during December break.
