Software Records:

11/25/2025:
- Old DriveActions code is inconsistent.
- Decided to switch to Roadrunner for better accuracy.
- Began tuning roadrunner for autonomous.
- Forward push test inconsistent due to a wrong motor naming.

11/26/2025:
- Finished tuning roadrunner.
- Long Autonomous code testing and completion.
- Roadrunner is very consistent.
- Created 6 artifact and 9 artifact long autonomous code to adapt to different scenarios.
- Quan wanted the autonomous to be empty the classifier ramp.
- Started working on Short Autonomous code.

11/27/2025:
- Short Autonomous code testing.
- strafeToLinearHeading() function is inaccurate.
- Tried other functions, but still inaccurate.
- Decided to use strafeTo() function instead.
- Roadrunner unable to move to position (24, 24)
- Back right wheel is unable to move.
- Roadrunner tried to move to coordinates (24, 24) but failed.
- Issue: Pulley came loose on back right wheel.
- Chat with Minh about fixing the pulley issue.
- Discussed with Minh about resetting the classifier ramp after autonomous.
- Realized that points for pattern are only awarded at the end of autonomous.
- Decided to focus on fixing the back right wheel issue first.
- Planned to have a team meeting on Sunday to discuss classifier resetting in autonomous.

11/28/2025:
- Created "Records" document to log software changes and issues.
- Documenting all changes and issues for future reference.
- Fixed back right wheel issue.
- Resumed testing Short Autonomous code for driver practice on Sunday (11/30/2025).
- Full field assembly at Sasha's house for blue autonomous and driver practice.
- Need to make short autonomous code for 6 artifacts and attempt 12 if we have time.
